# Team Profile Generator

Project Repo: [Github-repo](https://github.com/timothymichaelcook/10_team_profile_generator)


## Description

The focus of this project was to create an application in that runs in the terminal, gathers user data about employees based on their job title. Every employee will be asked to input their name, id and email. Specific employees will be asked questions based on their job title. For examples, engineers will be asked to provide their GitHub username while interns will be asked what school they attended. The output file will display the user input in one CSS container and multiple CSS cards.

## User Story

```
- AS A manager
- I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
- SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Installation

- Inquirer package (for user prompts)
- Jest package (for running tests)
- npm i
- npm run test
- node index.js

## Usage

Users needs to be in the root folder of the project and 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies. Once installed, users will need to run 'node index.js' to start the application in the terminal window. Once the user inputs the required fields, a prompt will ask if you would like to add another employee. If no, a file named team.html will be created in the dist directory. Open the html file in a browser to view the output file.
